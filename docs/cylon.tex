\section{Definitions}

Disclaimer :{\it This document is a work in progress. Here only talk about classical physics (200 years old stuff) and all definitions and formulas are consistent within that framework. Classical physics works well for objects that have relative velocity much smaller than the speed of light and are macroscopic thus not affected by the measurement process.}

The word {\bf Physics} comes the greek {\it physik\'e} which means
{\it science of nature}. It is the study of natural phenomena by means of
quantitative observations and formal languages such as
mathematics. The ultimate goal of physics is that describing the
entire universe using few fundamental laws expressed in the
mathematical languages.

A {\bf Cartesian coordinate system} is a framework that allows to specify each point uniquely using numerical coordinates, which are the distances from the point to D fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just axis of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin. The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin. Given two points identified by coordinates $\vec p = (p_x,p_y,p_z)$ and $\vec q = (q_x,q_y,q_z)$, the distance between the two points is given by 
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{(p_x-q_x)^2+(p_y-q_y)^2+(p_z-q_z)^2}
\end{equation}
and indicated with $d_{pq} = \left|\vec p - \vec q\right|$.

A {\bf reference frame} or {\bf observational frame of reference} is a set of axes and their orientation, tied together with information about the motion of the observer. For example you can have two observers at the same location at the same moment in time but in motion one respect to the other. They may use the same set of axes and the same orientation yet, when measuring speed of objects respect to their own speed they will find different values. In particular if we get in the shoes of observer $O$ and we measure the speed of point $P$ we find veloticy $\vec v$. If we instead get of the shoes of observer $O'$ and we measure the speed of point $P$ we find a velocity $\vec v'$. This means that the velocity of observer $O'$ as measured by $O$ is $\vec w = \vec v-\vec v'$ and the veloticy of $O$ as measured by $O'$ is $\vec w' = - \vec w = \vec v'-\vec v$. This law of composition of velocities is called {\bf Galilean Invariance}.

A reference frame is called an {\bf intertial reference frame} if it describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner. An observer is in an inertial reference frame if the observer feels no force acting upon him/her. All inertial frames are in a state of constant, rectilinear motion with respect to one another.
If an observer $A$ in an inertial reference frame and he/she measures the position and velocity of a point $P$ as $\vec p,\vec v_p$, then a different observer $B$ from a reference frame moving at velocity $\vec w$ respect to $A$ will measure different position and velocity for the same point $P$, $\vec p' = \vec p-\vec w t,\vec v'_p = \vec p-\vec w$. Laws of physics like $F=ma$ are normally formulated in an inertial reference frame and require ``corrections'' when used in a non-inertial reference frame.

{\bf Degrees of freedom} are the number of parameters required to specify the state of a system. A particle is only identified by its coordinates (3 numbers in 3D). A rigid body is identified by its position and its orientation (3+3=6 numbers in 3D). A system comprised of $n$ point particles and $m$ constraints has $3n-m$ degrees of freedom. A system comprised of $n$ rigid bodies and $m$ constraints has $6n-m$ degrees of freedom.

\section{Notation}

3D Vectors are indicated with a {\it vector} on top, as in $\vec p$. The norm of a vector is indicated with $|\vec p|$ or with the same letter as the vector without decoration, $p$. The direction of a vector $\vec p/p$ is indicated with a {\it hat}, $\hat p$ and it is called a {\it versor}.

We use the letter $t$ to label time, the label $i$ to label parts of a system (for example components of a rigid body), the labels $j=0,1,2=X,Y,Z$ and $k=0,1,2=X,Y,Z$ to indicate components of a vector. Quaternions also have an extra index $j,k=W=3$. 4D Vectors (used here to represent quaternions) are marked with a {\it tilde} superscript, as in $\tilde \theta$.

Here is a legend for the notation used in these notes:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
Name & Symbol \\ \hline
point & $A$, $B$, $P$, ... \\
position & $\vec p$, $\vec p_A$, $\vec q$, ... \\
component of a vector & $p_k$ for $k=1,2,3$ or $k=X,Y,Z$ \\
velocity & $\vec v$ \\
acceleration & $\vec a$ \\
momentum & $\vec K = m \vec v$ \\
mass & $m$ \\
force & $\vec F$ \\
% orientation & $\tilde{\theta}$ \\
rotation & $R$ \\
angular velocity & $\vec \omega$ \\
angular acceleration & $\vec \alpha$ \\
angular momentum & $\vec L = I \vec \omega$ \\
inertia tensor & $I$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

We use the symbol $=$ to indicate en equivalence (result of an observation, consequence of a formula, or an assumption) but we use the symbol $\equiv$ to indicate a definition (the left hand term defined in terms of the right hand term).

\section{Newton First and Second Laws}

Classical Mechanis starts with Newton's Laws. The first two of them can be summarized as follows:

\begin{quote}
When observed from an inertial reference frame, objects like to move at constant velocity. If an object changes its velocity we say it is subject to a force. A force is something external that acts on the object and is proportional to its acceleration. The proportionality factor is a property of the object which we call mass.
\end{quote}

Let's measure the position of an object at different times...

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccccccc} \hline
time & $t$ & $t+dt$ & $t+2dt$ & $t+3dt$ & $t+4dt$ & $t+5dt$ & ... \\
position & $\vec p_t$ & $\vec p_{t+dt}$ & $\vec p_{t+2dt}$ & $\vec p_{t+3dt}$ & $\vec p_{t+4dt}$ & $\vec p_{t+5dt}$ & ... \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We define the velocity as the change in position per unit of time:
\begin{equation}
\vec v_t \equiv \frac{\vec p_{t+dt}-\vec p_t}{dt}
\label{one}
\end{equation}
and we define the acceleration as the change in velocity per unit of time
\begin{equation}
\vec a_t \equiv \frac{\vec v_{t+dt}-\vec v_t}{dt}
\label{two}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc} \hline
time & $t$ & $t+dt$ & $t+2dt$ & ... \\
position & $\vec p_t$ & $\vec p_{t+dt}$ & $\vec p_{t+2dt}$ & ... \\
velocity & $\vec v_t = \frac{\vec p_{t+dt}-\vec p_t}{dt}$ & $\vec v_{t+dt} = \frac{\vec p_{t+2dt}-\vec p_{t+dt}}{dt}$ & ... & ... \\
acceleration & $\vec a_t = \frac{\vec v_{t+dt}-\vec v_t}{dt}$ & ... & ... & ... \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If we can determine $\vec p$ at different times, we can compute $v$ and $a$ at different times. Notice that if the velocity is constant the acceleration is zero:
\begin{equation}
\vec a_t \equiv (\vec v_{t+dt}-\vec v_t)/dt = 0
\end{equation}
We now solve eq.~\ref{one} and eq.~\ref{two} in $\vec p_{t+dt}$ and $\vec v_{t+dt}$ respectively. We find:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec p_{t+dt} &=& \vec p_t + \vec v_t dt \\ 
\vec v_{t+dt} &=& \vec v_t + \vec a_t dt 
\label{changes}
\end{eqnarray}

The Newton's laws (as stated above) say that if the velocity changes. I.e. there is an acceleration, then the object is subject to a force. The law does not say that if two objects are subject to the same force, they will have the same acceleration. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that
\begin{equation}
\vec F_t \propto \vec a_t
\end{equation}
and the proportionality factor is different for different objects. We call this proportionality factor $m$:
\begin{equation}
\vec F_t = m \vec a_t
\label{newton2}
\end{equation}
We replace the solution of eq.~\ref{newton2} for $a_t$ in eq.~\ref{changes} and we obtain:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec p_{t+dt} &=& \vec p_t + \vec v_t dt \label{p_update} \\
\vec v_{t+dt} &=& \vec v_t + (1/m) \vec F_t dt \label{v_update}
\end{eqnarray}

In other words: {\it if we know the position and the velocity of the object, and the force acting on the object at time $t$ we can compute the position and the velocity at time $t+dt$.}

The set of eqs.~\ref{p_update} and \ref{v_update} are called an {\it Euler integrator}. Technically they are only correct in the limit $dt\rightarrow 0$ but they provide a decent approximation for small $dt$ if the force does not change significnaly over the time interval $dt$.

So far we assumed $m$ is constant. What if $m$ changes with time? A more accurate way to write the Newton equation is in terms of a quantity we call {\it momentum}, defined as:
\begin{equation}
\vec K_t \equiv m_t \vec v_t 
\end{equation}
In terms of $\vec K_t$, eq.~\ref{newton2} can be written as
\begin{equation}
\vec F_t = \frac{\vec K_{t+dt}-\vec K_t}{dt} 
\label{newton21}
\end{equation}

Now we can perform a change of variables from $v$ to $K$ and rewrite the Euler integrator as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec F_t =& \sum_i \vec F_i &\qquad \textrm{(compute force)}\\
\vec v_{t} =& m_t^{-1}\vec K_{t} &\qquad \textrm{(compute velocity)}\\
\vec p_{t+dt} =& \vec p_t + \vec v_t dt &\qquad \textrm{(update position)}\\
\vec K_{t+dt} =& \vec K_t + \vec F_t dt &\qquad \textrm{(update momentum)}\label{euler21}
\end{eqnarray}

In other words: {\it if we know the position and the momentum of the object, and the force acting on the object at time $t$, we can compute the position and the momentum at time $t+dt$. If we know the mass of the object we can compute the velocity from the momentum.}

If multiple forces act of the same object, $\vec F$ is the sum of those forces:
\begin{equation}
\vec F = \sum_i \vec F_i
\end{equation}
where $\vec F_i$ is the force caused by interation $i$ (could be gravity, could be a spiring, etc.). This called {\it d'Alambert's principle}.

\section{Types of Forces and Newton Third Law}

Here we are exclusively intersted in the following types of forces:

\subsection{Gravity}

\begin{equation}
\vec F_t^{gravity} \equiv (0, -m_t g, 0) 
\end{equation}
where $g = 9.8$meters/second.

\subsection{Spring}

\begin{equation}
  \vec F_t^{spring} \equiv \kappa (|\vec q_t - \vec p_t|-L) \frac{\vec q_t-\vec p_q}{|\vec q_t-\vec p_t|}
\end{equation}
where $\vec p_t$ is the position of the mass at time $t$, $q_t$ is the position of the other end of the spring at the same time, $\kappa$ is a constant that describes the rigidity of the spring, and $L$ is the rest length of the spring. Notice that when $|\vec p_t - \vec q_t|=L$ there is no force, when $|\vec p_t - \vec q_t|>L$ the force is attractive and when $|\vec p_t - \vec q_t|<L$ the force is repulsive. 

\subsection{Friction}

\begin{equation}
  \vec F_t^{friction} \equiv - \gamma \vec v_t
\end{equation}
$\gamma$ is called the {\it friction coefficient}.

Newton's third law states that if a body A exercises a force $F$ on a body B, then body B exercies a force $-F$ on body $A$. In any simulation we have to account for this using force generators that link objects to each other.

\section{Rotations}

A position vector $\vec p$ can be multiplied by a matrix
\begin{equation}
\vec p' = R \vec p
\end{equation}
The matrix multiplication maps one vector $p$ onto another vector $p'$. If we now require that the matrix $R$ have determinant equal to 1 it follows that for every vector $p$
\begin{equation}
|\vec p'| = |R\vec p| = |R||\vec p| = |\vec p|
\end{equation}
i.e. the $R$ transformation preserves the vector length. If we also requires that the inverse of $R$ be the same as its transposed ($R^{-1}=R^t$) then, for every two vectors $p$ and $q$ we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\vec p' \cdot \vec q' = (R\vec p)\cdot(R\vec q) = \vec p \cdot \vec q
\end{equation}
i.e. the $R$ transformation preserves scalar products (and therefore angles).
A matrix $R$ meeting the two conditions above is called an {\it orthogonal matrix} or a {\it rotation}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{images/plane.png}
\end{center}

A rotation of the angle $\theta$ around the $X$-axes can be written as
\begin{equation}
R_X(\theta) \equiv \left(\begin{tabular}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & $\cos(\theta)$ & $-\sin(\theta)$  \\
0 & $\sin(\theta)$ & $\cos(\theta) $ 
\end{tabular}\right)
\end{equation}

A rotation of the angle $\theta$ around the $Y$-axes can be written as
\begin{equation}
R_Y(\theta) \equiv \left(\begin{tabular}{ccc}
$\cos(\theta)$ & 0 & $\sin(\theta)$ \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
$-\sin(\theta)$ & 0 & $\cos(\theta)$ 
\end{tabular}\right)
\end{equation}

A rotation of the angle $\theta$ around the $Z$-axes can be written as
\begin{equation}
R_Z(\theta) \equiv \left(\begin{tabular}{ccc}
$\cos(\theta)$ & $-\sin(\theta)$ & 0 \\
$\sin(\theta)$ & $\cos(\theta)$ & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{tabular}\right)
\end{equation}

A rotation of the angle $\theta$ around an arbitrary direction $\hat n = (n_x,n_y,n_z)$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
R_{\hat n}(\theta) = \left(\begin{tabular}{ccc} 
$t n_x n_x+c$ & $t n_x n_y-s n_z$ & $t n_x n_z+s n_y$ \\
$t n_x n_y+s n_z$ & $t n_y n_y+c$ & $t n_y n_z-s n_x$ \\
$t n_x n_z-s n_y$ & $t n_y n_z+s n_x$ & $t n_z n_z+c$
\end{tabular}\right)
\label{rotexpanded}
\end{equation}
where $c=\cos(\theta)$ and $s=\sin(\theta)$ and $t=(1-\cos(\theta))$.

It is also conventinent to merge the directional information $\hat n$ with the angular information $\theta$ into a single vector $\vec \theta \equiv \theta \hat n$ and use the more compact notation:

\begin{equation}
R(\vec \theta) \equiv R_{\hat n}(\theta)
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{images/rotation.png}
\end{center}

A rotation can also be used to represent the orientation of a body.

If a body is oriented according to $R(\vec \theta)$ and it gets rotated by another matrix $R(\vec \beta)$ the body will end up being oriented in a different direction:
\begin{equation}
R(\vec \theta') = R(\vec \beta) R(\vec \theta)
\end{equation}
notice that
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec \beta &=& (\beta m_x, \beta m_y, \beta m_z) \\
\vec \theta &=& (\theta n_x, \theta n_y, \theta n_z) \\
\vec \theta' &=& (\theta' n'_x, \theta' n'_y, \theta' n'_z)
\end{eqnarray}
For an infinitesimal rotation $\beta = \omega dt$ we can write
\begin{equation}
R' = R(\vec \omega dt) R
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\vec \omega \equiv (\omega n_x, \omega n_y, \omega n_z)
\label{avelocity}
\end{equation}
is called angular velocity. What is the explicit expression for $R(\vec \omega dt)$ and first order in $dt$?

\section{Spinning Objects}

When a body is rotating with contant angular velocity $\vec \omega$, its rotation is proportional to time $t$ only. We say the body is spinning. Here we consider body spinning around the direction $\hat n=(n_x,n_y,n_z)$ of an anglular velocity $\omega$. The angular position of the object at time $t$ is therefore $\theta_t = \omega t$.
It is orinetation at time $t$ is therefore given by:
\begin{equation}
\vec \theta_t \equiv (\omega t n_x, \omega t n_y, \omega t n_z)
\end{equation}
So if we now consider the position of a vector $\vec p$ subject to rotation we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\vec p_t = R(\vec \theta_t) \vec p
\label{rottheta}
\end{equation}
and we can compute it velocity using the definition:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec v_t &=& (\vec p_{t+dt} - \vec p_t)/dt \\
         &=& (R(\vec \theta_{t+dt}t) \vec p - R(\vec \theta_t) \vec p)/dt \\
         &=& \vec \omega \times \vec p
\label{vomega}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec \omega$ is the angular velocity, same as eq.~\ref{avelocity}.

\section{Newton Second Law for Rotation}

Before we have formulated the second law of Newton as
\begin{equation}
\vec F_t = \frac{\vec K_{t+dt}-\vec K_t}{dt}
\end{equation}
where $\vec K_t = m_t \vec v_t$.
We now consider a rigid body comprised of one mass $m$ at position $\vec p$, connected by a solid rod at the origin of the axes. The mass is subject to a force $\vec F$.

If there were no rod, the mass would move according to the Newton equation above. Because of the rod, the mass is not free and it feels only the component of the force ortoghonal to the direction of the rod $\vec r$ which is the same as the position of the mass $\vec p$ because the rod is pinned at the origin of the axes. In order to apply Newton law only to the components orthogonal to $r$ we perform a cross product of both terms

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec r_t \times \vec F_t &=& \vec r_t \times \frac{\vec  K_{t+dt}-\vec  K_t}{dt} \\
&=&  \frac{\vec r_t \times\vec K_{t+dt}-\vec r_t \times \vec  K_t}{dt}
\label{angular}
\end{eqnarray}
and if we define the {\it torque} as
\begin{equation}
\vec \tau \equiv \vec r \times \vec F
\end{equation}
and the {\it angular momentum} as
\begin{equation}
\vec L \equiv \vec r \times \vec K = m  \vec r \times \vec v
\label{angular_momentum}
\end{equation}
we can rewrite eq.~\ref{angular} as 
\begin{equation}
\vec \tau_ t = \frac{L_{t+dt}-L_t}{dt}
\label{newton_rot}
\end{equation}
which is the anologous of {\it Newton equation for rotations}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{images/torque.png}
\end{center}

Notice that if we substiture eq.~\ref{vomega} which gives the velocity in terms of the angualar velocity into eq.~\ref{angular_momentum} we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\vec L = \vec r \times (m \vec \omega \times \vec r) = (m |\vec r|^2) \vec \omega
\label{angular_momentum2}
\end{equation}
The coefficient $(m |\vec r|^2)$ is called {\it moment of inertia}.

Let us now consider a rigid body comprised of many masses subject to constraints. For each mass $m_i$ at point $r_i$ we can write:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \vec \tau_0 &=& \vec L_0 \\
  \vec \tau_1 &=& \vec L_1 \\
  \vec \tau_2 &=& \vec L_2 \\
  ... && ... \\
  \sum_i \vec \tau_i &=& \sum_i \vec L_i \\
  \vec \tau &=& \vec L
\end{eqnarray}
In the last step we have used the following definitions:
\begin{equation}
\vec \tau \equiv \sum_i \vec \tau_i = \sum_i \vec r_i \times \vec F_i
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\vec L \equiv \sum_i \vec L_i = \sum_i \vec r_i \times \vec K_i = m_i  \vec r_i \times \vec v_i
\label{angular_momentum3}
\end{equation}
Eq.~\ref{newton_rot} is still valid, but eq.~\ref{angular_momentum3} becomes:
\begin{equation}
\vec L = \sum _i \vec r_i \times (m_i \vec \omega \times \vec r_i) = I \vec \omega
\label{angular_momentum4}
\end{equation}
where $I$ is a 3x3 matrix, called {\it Inertia Tensor} with components:
\begin{equation}
I_{jk} \equiv \sum_i m_i (\delta_{jk} |\vec r_i|^2 - r_{i,j} r_{i,k})
\label{momentum_inertia}
\end{equation}
Here $r_{i,j}$ is the $j$-th component (X=0,Y=1, or Z=2) of vector $\vec r_i$.


Finally we can augment the Euler integrator with equivelent formulas for rotations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec F_t =& \sum_i \vec F_i & \qquad \textrm{(compute force)} \\
\vec \tau_t =& \sum_i \vec r_i \times \vec F_i & \qquad \textrm{(compute torque)}\\
\vec v_{t} =& m_t^{-1}\vec K_{t} & \qquad \textrm{(compute velocity)}\\
\vec \omega_t =& I_t^{-1} L_t & \qquad \textrm{(compute angular velocity)}\\
\vec p_{t+dt} =& \vec p_t + \vec v_t dt & \qquad \textrm{(update position)}\\
\vec K_{t+dt} =& \vec K_t + \vec F_t dt & \qquad \textrm{(update momentum)}\\
% \tilde \theta_{t+dt} =& \tilde \theta_t + \frac{1}{2} \vec \omega_t \tilde \theta_t dt &  \qquad \textrm{(update orientation)}\\
R_t = & R(\omega_t dt) R_t & \qquad \textrm{(update orientation)}\\
\vec L_{t+dt} =& \vec L_t + \vec \tau_t dt & \qquad \textrm{(update angular momentum)}
\label{euler22}
\end{eqnarray}

In other words: {\it If we know the state of the rigid body characterized by the position $p_t$ and momentum $K_t$ of its center of mass, if we know its orientation $T_t$ and its angular momentum $L_t$, and if we know the total force $F_t$ and the total torque $\tau_t$ acting on the body, we can compute new state of the rigid body ($p,K,R,L$) at time $t+dt$.}

Given the position $p_t$ of the center of mass of the body and its orientation $\tilde \theta_t$, a generic point $\vec r_i$ of the body, can be rotated and translated into the global reference frame according to:
\begin{equation}
R_t \vec r_i + p_t
\end{equation}
and the velocity of the point is
\begin{equation}
\vec \omega_t \times \vec r_i + \vec v_t
\end{equation}

%($R(...)$ is described in eq.~\ref{rotation}).

The position of a point $\vec p$ rotated by $R$ around point $\vec q$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
\vec p' = R(\vec p-\vec q)+\vec q = R \vec p + (1-R)\vec q
\end{equation}

\section{Assembling Rigid Bodies}

Consider a composite rigid body whose parts are smaller rigid bodies characterized by
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc} \hline
Component & Position & Mass & Moment of Inertial \\ \hline
0 & $\vec p_0$ & $m_0$ & $I_0$ \\ 
1 & $\vec p_1$ & $m_1$ & $I_1$ \\ 
2 & $\vec p_2$ & $m_2$ & $I_2$ \\ 
... & ... & ... & ... \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The composite object will have:
\begin{eqnarray}
m_{total} &=& \sum_i m_i \\
\vec p_{cm} &=& \sum \vec p_i m_i/m_{total} \\
I_{total} &=& \sum_i I_i + \Delta I(m_i, \vec p_i - \vec p_{total})
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}
\Delta I(m, \vec r)_{jk} \equiv m (\delta_{jk} |\vec r|^2 - r_j r_k)
\end{equation}

The object $I$ is a $3\times 3$ matrix and it is called {\it Inertia Tensor}. The inertia tensor depends on the orienttation of the object. If the object is rotated by $R_t$, the inertia tensor changes:

\begin{equation}
I_0 \rightarrow I_t = R_t I_0 R_t^{-1}
\end{equation}

\section{Quaternions}

Quaterions provide a way to representant an orientation in 3D without using a rotation but using a 4-vector instead. They are not used in the code because they are not necessary.

It can be convenient to define a four dimension vector (marked by a tilde):
\begin{equation}
\tilde \theta = (\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3) = (n_x \sin(\theta/2), n_y \sin(\theta/2), n_z \sin(\theta/2),\cos(\theta/2))
\label{quaternion}
\end{equation}
and with a change of variable the matrix of rotation $R_{\hat n}(\theta)$ can be re-written:

\begin{equation}
R(\tilde \theta) \equiv \left(\begin{tabular}{ccc}
$2(\theta_0 \theta_0 + \theta_1 \theta_1)-1$ & $2(\theta_0 \theta_1 - \theta_2 \theta_3)$ & $2(\theta_0 \theta_2 - \theta_1 \theta_3) $\\
$2(\theta_0 \theta_1 + \theta_2 \theta_3)$ & $2(\theta_1 \theta_1 +\theta_3 \theta_3)-1$ & $2(\theta_1 \theta_2-\theta_0 \theta_3) $\\
$2(\theta_0 \theta_3 - \theta_1 \theta_3)$ & $2(\theta_0 \theta_3 + \theta_1 \theta_2)$ & $2(\theta_2 \theta_2 + \theta_3 \theta_3)-1$
\end{tabular}\right)
\label{rotation}
\end{equation}

The 4-vector $\tilde \theta$ defines an {\it orientation} and it is called a {\it quaternion} although its mathematical properties are not relevant here and are not discussed. The associated matrix $R(\tilde \theta)$ can be used to rotates the points of an object into an orientation.

If a body is oriented according to $R(\tilde \theta)$ and it gets rotated by another matrix $R_{\hat n}(\beta)$ the body will end up being oriented in a different direction:
\begin{equation}
R(\tilde \theta') = R_{\hat n}(\beta) R(\tilde \theta)
\end{equation}

What's  $\tilde \theta'$ as function of $\hat n$, $\beta$ and $\tilde \theta$?
An explicit calculation (omitted) reveals:
\begin{equation}
\tilde \theta' = \tilde \theta + \frac{1}{2}\vec \beta \tilde \theta
\label{theta_update}
\end{equation}
where $\vec \beta \tilde \theta$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\vec \beta \tilde \theta = \left(\begin{tabular}{c}
$- (\beta_0 \theta_0 + \beta_1 \theta_1 + \beta_2 \theta_2)$ \\
$(\beta_0 \theta_3 + \beta_1 \theta_2 - \beta_2 \theta_1)$ \\ 
$(\beta_1 \theta_3 + \beta_2 \theta_0 - \beta_0 \theta_2)$ \\ 
$(\beta_2 \theta_3 + \beta_0 \theta_1 - \beta_1 \theta_0)$ 
\label{vxq}
\end{tabular}\right)
\end{equation}

where $(\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2)=(\beta n_x,\beta n_y,\beta n_z)$

Eq.~\ref{theta_update} will come up handy later when talking about spinning objects. In this case for an infinitesimal rotation $\beta=\omega dt$:
\begin{equation}
\tilde \theta' = \tilde \theta + \frac{1}{2}\vec \omega \tilde \theta dt
\end{equation}

\section{Conservation Laws}

The third Newton law says that for each force $\vec F_i$ there is an opposite force $\vec F_j = -F_i$ acting on a different body. This means that we add up all forces acting on all bodies:
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \vec F_i = \sum_i \mathrm{d}\vec K_i/ \mathrm{d}t = 0
\end{equation}
(where we used the dot notation to indicate a derivative). This is equivalent to te statement that
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \vec K_i = constant
\end{equation}
This is called {\it conservation of momentum}. It states that the sum of momenta $K$ of all bodies has to be contant.

It can be proven (but we do not because it requires Lagrangian Mechanics) that for each inveriance of the system there is an associated conservation law.

Translation invariance implies {\it Consevration of momentum}: 
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \vec K_i = constant
\end{equation}
Rotation invariance implies {\it Conservation of angular momentum}:
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \vec L_i = constant
\end{equation}
Time translation invariance implies {\it Conservation of energy}:
\begin{equation}
\sum_i E_i = constant
\end{equation}
where $E_i$, the energy of body $i$ and it equal to:
\begin{equation}
E_i = \frac 12 m v_i^2 + \frac 12 I \omega_i^2 - \int_{t_0}^t \vec F_i(t) \cdot \vec v_i(t) dt
- \int_{t0}^t \vec \tau_i(t) \cdot\vec \omega_i(t) dt
\end{equation}
The difference pieces are called respectively: kinetic energy, rotational kinetic energy, poetntial energy, and rotational potential energy. They measure respectively: how fast the body moves, how fast it spins, how much work was done by the forces acting upon it, and how much work was done by the torques accting upon it. $t_0$ is a time that one can start arbitrarily and by convention.

\section{Collisions}

Let's first consider particles instead of rigid bodies.

Given the velocities of two bodies $\vec v_A$ and $\vec v_B$ before a collision we want to determine the velocities of the bodies after the collision, $\vec v'_A$ and $\vec v'_B$. The closing velocity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\vec v_{closing} \equiv \vec v_B - \vec v_A
\end{equation}

The separating velocity (relative velocity after the collision) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\vec v_{separating} \equiv \vec v'_B - \vec v'_A
\end{equation}
The separating velocity can be written in terms of the closing velocity:
\begin{equation}
\vec v_{separating} = -c \vec v_{closing}
\label{collision}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a restitution coefficient. For an elastic collision $c=1$ and for an inelastic collision $c=0$.
Conservation of momentum and the above relation between closing and separating velocity yields:
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec K'_A &=& \vec K_A + \vec J \\
\vec K'_B &=& \vec K_B - \vec J 
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}
\vec J = \frac{(c+1)\vec v_{closing} \cdot \hat n}{1/m_A+1/m_B} \hat n
\end{equation}

In the case of collision of the object A with a plane B or other object of infinite mass
\begin{equation}
\vec K'_A = \vec K_A + \lim_{m_A-\rightarrow \infty} + \vec J = \vec K_A + m_A (c+1) (\vec v_{closing} \cdot \hat n) \hat n
\end{equation}

When the $v_{closing}$ is in the same direction as $n$ then:

\begin{equation}
\vec K'_A = \vec K_A + m_A (c+1) \vec v_{closing}
\end{equation}

In the case of rigid bodies eq.~\ref{collision} applies to the points of contact between two rigid bodies.  The collision is completed determined by the collision point $\vec q$ and the normal to the collision plane $\hat n$.

To properly consider its effect on the entire body we have to rewrite the velocity in terms of the velocities of the center of mass plus a component due to the angular velocity.

\begin{equation}
{\vec J}_{\perp} = \frac {(c+1) \vec v_{closing}) \cdot \hat n}{1/m_A+1/m_B + \left[ (1/I_A)(\vec r_{cA} \times \hat n)\times r_{cA}  + (1/I_B)(\vec r_{cB} \times \hat n) \times r_{rB}\right] \cdot {\hat n}}{\hat n}
\label{impulse}
\end{equation}

Here $\vec r_{cA} = \vec q-\vec p_A$ is the point of collision respect to the center of mass $\vec p_A$, $\vec v_{cA} = \vec \omega_A \times \vec r_A + \vec v_A$ is the velocity of the collision point before the collision, $m_A$ is the mass of body A, $I_A$ is its moment of inertia. $\hat n$ is a versor orthogonal to the contact point. Similarly, $\vec r_{cB} = \vec q-\vec p_B$ and $\vec v_{cB} = \vec \omega_B \times \vec r_B + \vec v_B$.

Once this impulse is computed we can deal with the it for each body by adding the contribution of the impulse to force and torque.

In presence of friction at the contact point, there is also a tangential impulse to take into account:

\begin{equation}
{\vec J}_{\parallel} = \frac{(c_f+1) \vec v_{closing} \cdot \hat t}{1/m_A+1/m_B + \left[ (1/I_A)(\vec r_{cA} \times \hat t)\times r_{cA}  + (1/I_B)(\vec r_{cB} \times \hat t) \times r_{rB}\right] \cdot {\hat t}}{\hat t}
\label{impulse}
\end{equation}

where $\hat t$ is a versor orthogonal to $n$ and to the relative velocity beween the colliding points:

\begin{equation}
  \hat t = \frac{\hat n \times \vec v_{closing}}{\left|\hat n \times\vec v_{closing}\right|}
\end{equation}

In general $c_f$ is different from $c$. 

Given the total inpulse $\vec J = \vec J_{\perp}+\vec J_{\parallel}$, we can resolve the collisiong by correcting the momenta and angular momenta:

\begin{eqnarray}
\vec K'_A &=& K_A + \vec J \\
\vec \tau'_A &=& \tau_A + \vec r_{cA} \times \vec J \\
\vec K'_B &=& K_B - \vec J \\
\vec \tau'_B &=& \tau_B - \vec r_{cB} \times \vec J
\label{impulse2}
\end{eqnarray}

For if two objects we do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item find the point of contact and compute $r_{cA}$, $r_{cB}$
\item find the compenetration and shift the objects back to cancel compenetration
\item compute the impulse (eq.~\ref{impulse})
\item update the force and torque to include one time contribution of the impulse (eq.~\ref{impulse2}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Geometry of collision}

Here we are concerned with the problem of terminating if two objects have collided. If the objects are made of vertices and faces the possible collisions can be vertex-vertex, vertex-edge, verted-face, edge-face, face-face. Most of them can be ignored but vertex-face and edge-edge.

Let's focus on vertex-face collision. In order to resolve the collisions we need to:
\begin{itemize}
\item detect a collision has occurred;
\item find the collision point, $\vec q$;
\item find the normal to the collision plane, $\hat n$;
\item resolve as in previous section.
\end{itemize}

We will assume the body is convex (the center of mass is inside the body).

We will label $\vec p_A$ the center of mass of body $A$, $\vec p_B$ the center of mass of body $B$, $\vec q$ the collision point, $\hat n$ the normal to the collision point, $\vec f_1$,$\vec f_2$,$\vec f_3$ the vertices of the face of $A$ and $\vec u$ the vertex of body $B$ which may have hit the face of object $A$.

First we compute $\vec n$:
\begin{equation}
\vec n = (\vec f_2 - \vec f_1) \times (\vec f_3 - \vec f_1)
\end{equation}
and normalized it $\hat n = \vec n / n$.
Than we compute $q$:
\begin{equation}
\vec q = \vec u - (\vec u \cdot \hat n - \vec f_1 \cdot \hat n){\hat n}
\end{equation}
And we check that $\vec q$ lays inside the face:
\begin{eqnarray}
|(\vec q - \vec f_1)\times(\vec f_2-\vec f_1)|&+& \\
|(\vec q - \vec f_2)\times(\vec f_3-\vec f_2)|&+& \\
|(\vec q - \vec f_3)\times(\vec f_1-\vec f_3)| &<=& |(\vec f_1 - \vec f_2)\times(\vec f_3-\vec f_1)|
\end{eqnarray}
If this is the case, we check the the projection along $\hat n$ of the points $\hat p_A$ (the center of mass of $A$), the vertex $\hat v$, the collision point $\vec q$ and $\vec p_B$ (the center of mass of $B$) and in proper spatial order:
\begin{equation}
((\vec p_A - \vec p_B) \cdot \hat n) ((\vec u - \vec q) \cdot\hat n) >=0
\end{equation}
If the collision occurs the penetration is $\vec p - \vec q$.

Finally we loop over all faces of $A$, and vertices of $B$, we run the above algorithm and if a collision occurs we resolve the penetration, we compute the velocity of the collision point and we apply the impulse at collision point as discussed in the previous section.
